WARNING:PhysDesignRules:774 - Unexpected DCM configuration. CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT
   is not configured VARIABLE for comp dcm_main. The PSEN pin is connected to an

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   498 out of     600   83%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       104 out of   1,200    8%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,484
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,356 out of   1,484   91%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              62 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
