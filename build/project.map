ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   175 out of   4,800    3%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 175
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      9,953 out of   2,400  414% (OVERMAPPED)
    Number used as logic:                    9,949 out of   2,400  414% (OVERMAPPED)
      Number using O6 output only:           8,400
      Number using O5 output only:              73
      Number using O5 and O6:                1,476
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      4
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         4
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        96 out of   1,200    8%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        9,958
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         9,822 out of   9,958   98%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of   9,958    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         131 out of   9,958    1%
    Number of unique control sets:              15
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              65 out of   4,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        10 out of     102    9%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       10 out of      10  100%
    IOB Flip Flops:                              9
